# Proton

Ever wanted a Bot to help you manage your Server? Well the answer is Proton

It has all the features you want online user tracking or welcome and goodbye messages

## Getting started

1. Clone the Repository and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=YOUR_GUILD_ID
```

3. Run `npm run syncdb` to create the database
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode

Note: You only need to add the `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` if you have only one server on which the bot should run. This allows you to register the commands faster.

## Usage
